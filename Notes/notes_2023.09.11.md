## Notes from Smith Lab meeting - 09.11.2023

Kelly
 - Screws ordered for Wiley mill
 - Barring tragedy, Wiley mill will hopefully be up and running sometime Wednesday afternoon

Monika
 - Chaotic field work, hopes that she will return on Wednesday
 - May need to push back return date given rain forecast
 - Only able to sample four species. Fifth species is only apparent in one plot

Evan
 - Perhaps worth a training on the Wiley mill/grinding devices to avoid future machine/safety issues

Eve
 - Hoping for first round of measurements on Thursday but needs to leave early. 
    - Wants some help to wrap up first day of measurements
 - Needs a Multispeq, but Multispeq left in the lab is currently uncalibrated
    - Likely only needs to calibrate SPAD meter as LI-600 measures fluorescence data

Isa
 - Needs help with soil cores this weekend

Reminders
 - LEMONTREE working group meeting on C4 A/Ci curves 8am tomorrow
 - First journal club this afternoon at 2pm
 - Chlorophyll extraction workshop with Alissar at 11am
